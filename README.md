## Hypothesis
We thought that the runtime of MergeSort would be O(nlogn) because the splitting is based off of logn (the number of times you have to split) and the amount of numbers that you have to remake are dependent on the size of the list which is O(n).

## Analysis
First trial:
Looking at the graph, our points don't seem to match up with either O(n), O(n^2) nor O(nlog(n)). Surprisingly, our points have the most in common with the graph of O(sqrtn).
Second trial:
We then proceeded to use helper methods and more points. Looking at this seperate graph, by focusing more on larger numbers rather than minute ones, we were able to see that the runtime of MergeSort most closely resembles nlogn.

## Conclusion
First trial:
The runtime corresponds to O(sqrtn).
Second trial:
The runtime corresponds to O(nlogn)
